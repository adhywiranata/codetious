> :wrench: Toolkit to analyze EcmaScript codes

## What

Evaluate EcmaScript (JavaScript) codes and select or validate them based on your use-cases. This library heavily uses [Esprima](https://github.com/jquery/esprima) an EcmaScript parser and acts as a wrapper to select or check the codes.

## Why

Sometimes we need to thoroughly check some codes, not just the output, wether it contains certain variable with proper naming, function that do things that we expected, or expressions that processed properly. This library helps to do what unit tests can't do.
